# CUDA-SGEMM

This repo walks through several implementations of *single precision generalized matrix multiplication*, or just **SGEMM**. Each implementation aims to be increasingly optimized than the last. 

The repo is intended to be educational.

## Optimizations
Each iteration has a `README.md` containing thorough explanations of the optimization. Additionally, they will guide you through how you might have deduced the need for such an optimization yourself via profiling.
